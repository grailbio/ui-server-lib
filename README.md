## Contents

The `@grail/server-lib` module holds both utility functions and constants used
across GRAIL UI server applications.

## Contributing

This project is open sourced. All content must be non-proprietary. For example:

- Do not include GRAIL assets, like GRAIL Logo, or commercially sourced images.
- Do not include content that has trade secrets or anything that should remain internal to GRAIL.

For common private GRAIL code, use `@grail/common-private` or other internal locations.

Modify CHANGELOG.md to reflect contributions to this code.

#### **Production Code Criteria**

- Unit tests.
  - At least 25% line coverage.

When introducing new code, you must include an `index.js`, which exports to the
`index.js` of the `src` directory.

Include `flow-typed` files as needed and categorized between ones
written for npm packages, and ones written for GRAIL's custom utility functions.
